unpublished-geocaches
=====================

On geocaching.com website, when you have created an unpublished cache, the gpx file isn't downloadable. It's a pity, and when you prepare an event, it is boring to create a gpx of your caches (even with GSAK, you will have to use copy/paste a lot)

The only automatic way to create a global gpx is to parse HTML content on geocaching.com. This needs your username and password, however it's the only way.

So, you can use this web app hosted here : [unpublished.vaguelibre.net](http://unpublished.vaguelibre.net/)
Your password is not saved but if you don't trust, please don't use it, download the code on github and use it on your own server.
