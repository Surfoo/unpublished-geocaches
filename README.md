unpublished-geocaches
=====================

On geocaching.com website, when you have created an unpublished cache, the gpx file isn't downloadable. And when you prepare an event, it is boring to create a gpx of your caches (even with GSAK, you will have to use copy/paste a lot).

With the new REST API from Groundspeak, we can now use it to fetch all the owner's unpublished geocaches!
